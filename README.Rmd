The goal of timetracker is to help you work with data from the [GoogleSheets
extension "Time
Tracker"](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/time_tracker/182790105381).

## Installation

You can install the development version of timetracker with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maurolepore/timetracker")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(googlesheets4)
library(timetracker)
```

Read your google sheet with googlesheets4.

```{r}
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yz1j_CuLVwQwkzxW_6kuZH1mCEWuD-n-rCy70aORyc0/edit?usp=sharing"
raw <- read_sheet(url)

tail(raw)
```

Wrangle the data with timetracker.

```{r}
time <- timetracker::wrangle(raw)

tail(time)
```

Analyze the data with familiar tidyverse packages.

```{r}
# Time spent by task in the last week
week <- 7
time |>
  filter(date == tail(unique(date), week)) |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = c("case_ref_number", "date"))

# Time spent across all tasks the last day
time |>
  filter(date == last(date)) |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = "date")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Bar plot showing hours versus date and line showing average hours
data <- time |>
  group_by(date) |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference)) |>
  # Convert spent from difftime to hours
  mutate(spent = as.numeric(spent, units = "hours")) |> 
  filter(!date < 2020) |> 
  filter(spent > 0, spent < 24) |> 
  arrange(date)

(.mean <- mean(data$spent))

# How many hours on average should I work each day of the year if I work 5 days a week, 8 hours each day, and have 30 vacation days?
expect <- 5
# How many hours do I actually work on average?
actual <- mean(data$spent)

ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = spent)) + 
  geom_col() +
  # add a line showing the mean
  geom_hline(yintercept = expect, color = "gray") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = actual, color = "red")
```
