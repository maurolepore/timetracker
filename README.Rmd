The goal of timetracker is to help you work with data from the [GoogleSheets
extension "Time
Tracker"](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/time_tracker/182790105381).

## Installation

You can install the development version of timetracker with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maurolepore/timetracker")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(googlesheets4)
library(timetracker)
```

Raw data.

```{r}
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yz1j_CuLVwQwkzxW_6kuZH1mCEWuD-n-rCy70aORyc0/edit?usp=sharing"
raw <- read_sheet(url)

tail(raw)
```

Wrangle.

```{r}
time <- timetracker::wrangle(raw)

tail(time)
```

Last month by task.

```{r}
# Time spent by task in the last week
days <- 30
time |>
  mutate(team = ifelse(grepl("^st ", case_ref_number), "stress", "tilt")) |>
  arrange(date) |> 
  slice_tail(n = days) |> 
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = c("team", "case_ref_number", "date")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(case_ref_number, spent), y = spent)) + 
    geom_col(aes(fill = team)) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(y = "hours") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Expected vs. actual worked hours in the last `r params$days` days.

```{r}
data <- time |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = "date") |>
  # Remove invalid
  filter(!date < 1900, spent > 0, spent < 24) |> 
  arrange(date) |> 
  slice_tail(n = as.numeric(params$days))

(.mean <- mean(data$spent))

# How many hours on average should I work each day of the year if I work 5 days a week, 8 hours each day, and have 30 vacation days?
weeks_in_year = 52
working_days_per_week = 5
vacation_days = 30
hours_per_day = 8
days_in_year = 365
# in a year without vacations
total_working_days = weeks_in_year * working_days_per_week
# subtracting vacations
actual_working_days = total_working_days - vacation_days
# in a year
total_working_hours = actual_working_days * hours_per_day
average_hours_per_day = total_working_hours / days_in_year

.expect <- average_hours_per_day
.actual <- mean(data$spent)

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = spent)) + 
    geom_col() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = .expect, color = "gray") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = .actual, color = "red") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 24, 1))
```
