# timetracker

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of timetracker is to help you work with data from the [GoogleSheets
extension "Time
Tracker"](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/time_tracker/182790105381).

## Installation

You can install the development version of timetracker with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("maurolepore/timetracker")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(googlesheets4)
library(timetracker)
```

Read your google sheet with googlesheets4.

```{r}
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pz9_Dn24DPpWpEXFggSwZJWSp0DHtYbgpeS1_90KtEA/edit?usp=sharing"
raw <- read_sheet(url)

tail(raw)
```

Wrangle the data with timetracker.

```{r}
time <- timetracker::wrangle(raw)

tail(time)
```

Analyze the data with familiar tidyverse packages.

```{r}
# Time spent by task in the last week
week <- 7
time |>
  filter(date == tail(unique(date), week)) |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = c("case_ref_number", "date"))

# Time spent across all tasks the last day
time |>
  filter(date == last(date)) |>
  summarise(spent = sum(difference), .by = "date")
```
